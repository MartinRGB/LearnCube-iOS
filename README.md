# LearnCube-iOS
An animation practise demo

##Asset I used...

I used [Swifticons](http://swifticons.com)in main UI for its subtle color and shape.
I also used [BigMug](https://dribbble.com/shots/1634821-440-Free-Icons)'s icon in tab bar,the designer is [Catalin Fertu](https://dribbble.com/catalinfertu)

##Why I Do This?

As a motion designer（[My Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/MartinRGB)）,I begin to learn some code.

When I saw the Lush App,I'm very interesting in its tabbar's deisgn.The Square moved in tab bar and changed color,I like the wonderful effect!That's why I make this demo.

In this demo,I try to use CABasicAnimation/POP Animation/Animatewithduration to make effect better.

##Final Effect

_This is the effect in Xcode_

Sorry for my poor code skill.I'm keep learning,welcome for suggest.


P.S Special Thanks to AlienJunX,he is always supporting me.
